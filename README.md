# Products-Scrapper
This repo contains my products scrapper scripts in python using Beautifulsoup, selenium etc for following websites:
1) Ali Express
2) Daraz
3) Made in china

which fetch products details i.e name, image, price, details, specifications etc and store them in an excel file which can be further use for dropshipping or data analysis etc.
Also, i have combined all of them in a django based web application. Soon i will be adding more websites to it.
